## 1. Project Idea and Objectives

### Main Idea
A **remote/symbolic goat adoption service** to finance infrastructures (e.g., fences, feed, wells) and support farmers in developing countries. Funds help poor families by providing goats for milk, cheese, and income.

### Objectives
- Raise awareness about rural poverty.
- Offer personalized updates (photos, videos, reports).
- Natural/organic products as perks (e.g., goat cheese from partners).

---

## 2. Target Audience

- Animal lovers, environmentalists, and fans of organic/natural products.
- People who want real impact with low-cost recurring donations.

## 3. Initial Budget and Timeline

| Expense Item | Approximate Cost (€) | Time Needed | Comments |
|--------------|----------------------|-------------|----------|
| Research & planning | 0-500 | 1-2 months | Online. |
| Association formation | 200-500 | 1 month | Simple form. |
| RUNTS/ETS registration | 100-300 | 1-3 months | For tax benefits. |
| Website + donations | 300-1,000 | 1 month | Include subscription integration (e.g., Stripe). |
| Partnerships + initial webcam (optional) | 500-2,000 extra | 2-4 months | For premium live cam (solar camera + YouTube/private streaming). |
| Other items (marketing, goat fund, etc.) | As above | - | - |
| **Total Updated** | **~5,500-7,000€** | **4-8 months** | Optional webcam addition. |

## 4. Service Model: Monthly Subscriptions (After Launch)

After the initial crowdfunding campaign, the service will move to **recurring subscriptions** for sustainability (covers goat maintenance, reports, and ongoing infrastructure). Prices inspired by NGO models (e.g., symbolic adoptions €10-50/month).

| Monthly Plan | Price (€/month) | Main Benefits |
|-------------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Base** | 9-15€ | Digital certificate, monthly photo/report of the goat, email updates. |
| **Standard** | 20-30€ | Everything in Base + personalized videos, 20-30% discount on organic products (e.g., shipped goat cheese), name on the goat. |
| **Premium** | 40-60€ | Everything in Standard + **exclusive access to live webcam** (see your goat/group in real time, 24/7 via app/private site), annual video call with farmers, annual organic product kit (cheese, goat milk soaps), priority on reports. |

**Note on Live Cam**: Feasible with local partners (e.g., farms in Africa/Asia). Costs: solar IP camera (~€200-500) + streaming (private YouTube or Vimeo, free/low-cost). Real examples: Farm Sanctuary, Folly Farm.
